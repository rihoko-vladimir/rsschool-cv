3. My goal is to repeat android fundamentals, solve some practical tasks, complete the final project using my knowledge. I've been learning android since January 2020, until June or so i'd used Java instead of Kotlin. In June i've read Kotlin in action, after that I'm actually writing everything using Kotlin. I like to learn new technologies and to solve difficult problems. And i'm also willing to know how everything i use work under the hood.
4. Java, Koltin, SQL, XML, SQLite, Retrofit, Glide, Picasso, Fresco, Room, OkHttp, Kotlin Coroutines, Git, RxJava, MVVM, MVP, a bit of Linux, etc...
